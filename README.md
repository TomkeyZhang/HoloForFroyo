HoloForFroyo
============

HoloForFroyo is a base project to start using it. The aim of this project is to provide a customizable holo interface on Froyo, Gingerbread and above.

It uses ActionBarSherlock and for that reason you must download or clone Jake Wharton's ActionBarSherlock project. We also created all the styles, assets and drawables
thanks to Android-holo-colors and ActionBar Style Generator.

If you need to create your own assets and drawables, for example with different color. Create it here:

source: <a href="http://android-holo-colors.com/">Android-holo-colors</a>

and for assets and drawables for the action bar, use:

source: <a href="http://jgilfelt.github.com/android-actionbarstylegenerator/">ActionBar Style Generator</a>

Remember to check the "Style Compatibility" --> "Sherlock"

If you need to copy only the asset and drawables you have to insert in "Style name" the word "holo" otherwise you have to rename all the drawables and assets with
your "Style Name"

NOTE: If you want to use and include my work in your project or app, please send me an email to include your app in our list.
