HoloForFroyo
============

HoloForFroyo is a base proyect to start using it. The aim of this proyect is to provide a customizable holo interface on Froyo, Gingerbread and above.

It uses ActionBarSherlock and for that reason you must download or clone Jake Wharton's ActionBarSherlock proyect. We also created all the styles, assets and drawables
thanks to Android-holo-colors and ActionBar Style Generator.

If you need to create your own assets and drawables, for example with different color. Create it here:

and for assets and drawables for the action bar, use:

Remember to check the "Style Compatibility" --> "Sherlock"

If you need to copy only the asset and drawables you have to insert in "Style name" the word "holo" otherwise you have to rename all the drawables and assets with
your "Style Name"
